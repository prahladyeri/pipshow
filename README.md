# pipshow

A script to show details of any python package, irrespective of whether its installed or not.

# Synopsis

I came across the need today to show details about a random PyPi package which wasn't installed on my machine yet. So I simply did `pip show <package_name>` but it didn't return anything. `pip` has also removed the `--no-install` option for simulating an install through which I could have known these details too. So I wrote this little script to show the details of any package even if it isn't installed on your machine.

# Installation

```bash
pip install pipshow
```

# Usage
